  <h2>Schema Similarity</h2>

  <p>
    This is a tool that implements a master thesis "A text similarity-based approach for extracting JSON conceptual schemas". This process is formed by ten algorithms whose six of then are working in this software.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project uses similarity measures to identify equivalent fields in JSON documents. Due to the availability of libraries, the Java language was used. It is executed via console, generating the output files in a directory called `out`.

## Quick Start

Several quick start options are available:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ftmachado/schema-similarity.git`
- Needs JDK 1.8 or higher and Maven Project 3.5.4
- This project have two external JARs that are not included in Maven Repo. There are many whats to include that in a project (see [3 ways to add local jar to Maven Project](http://http://roufid.com/3-ways-to-add-local-jar-to-maven-project/)). The simplest one is local install libs and build with assembly plugin to include these dependencies. And that is it! Follow the steps below:
- Needs install localy the JARs (located in lib/ folder):
- Ws4j:`mvn install:install-file -Dfile={basedir}/lib/ws4j-1.0.1.jar -DgroupId=de.sciss -DartifactId=ws4j -Dversion=1.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`
- Jawjaw: `mvn install:install-file -Dfile={basedir}/lib/jawjaw-1.0.2.jar -DgroupId=de.sciss -DartifactId=jawjaw -Dversion=1.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`
- Then our libs will be installed in `C:\Users\YourUser\.m2\repository\de\sciss\ws4j\1.0.1\ws4j-1.0.1.jar`
- In pom.xml these are declared as any other dependencie
- If you have some error in pom.xml, see the note in topic 3.

## Run

- Run Maven Package, and the assembly-plugin will generate something like `-jar-with-dependencies`, these are the correct JAR! The file generated by maven-jar will not works because these external libraries.
- Execute the line command: `java -jar target/schema-similarity-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## Whats included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files. You'll see something like this:
